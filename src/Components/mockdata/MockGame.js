As the aether begins to fade and the lifeless deadlands spread ever further, so too does the struggle for possession of the final flickers of the Mothers' light grow ever more fierce.\n\nYet amidst the gathering storm, there are those who believe that the legacy of the crystals has shaped mankind's destiny for long enough.",
